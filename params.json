{"name":"conchk","tagline":"IP Network connectivity checker, designed for batch mode, multi-machine operation","body":"conchk\r\n======\r\n\r\nconchk is an IP connectivity test tool designed to validate that all configured IP connectivity actually works\r\n\r\nIt reads a list of tests and executes them, in parallel, based on the contents of each line in the input file. conchk supports tcp and udp based tests (IPv4 and IPv6), at this time.\r\n\r\n==Notes==\r\n* testing a range of supports is supported. In this case the rules for a successful test are somewhat different\r\n** If one of the ports gets a successful connect, and the rest are refused (connection refused) as nothing is listening then this is considered to be a successful test of the range. This is the most common scenario in our experience; the firewalls and routing are demonstrably working, and at least one destination service is ok. If you need all ports to work then consider using individual tests\r\n* If all tests for this host pass, then conchk will exit(0). Otherwise it will exit(1)\r\n* conchk will use the current hostname, or the commandline parameter, to find the tests approprate to execute. This means all the tests for a system, or project can be placed in one file\r\n* The .csv output option will write a file much like the input file, but with two additional columns and without any comments. This file can be fed back into conchk without error.\r\n\r\nDownload latest builds\r\n* [Mac 64-bit](http://www.fitzsimons.org/ci/conchk-mac64.tar.gz) \r\n* [Linux 32-bit](http://www.fitzsimons.org/ci/conchk-linux32.tar.gz) \r\n* [Windows 64-bit - Vista, Win7, Win8](http://www.fitzsimons.org/ci/conchk-win64.tar.gz) \r\n* [Windows 32-bit - XP](http://www.fitzsimons.org/ci/conchk-win32.tar.gz) \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
